# Zenith Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: January 2026*

## The Short Version

**We don't collect your data. Period.**

Zenith connects directly to your own services. We never see your files, credentials, or viewing habits.

## What We Don't Collect

- No analytics or tracking
- No usage statistics
- No crash reports sent to us
- No advertising identifiers

## Your Connections

### Jellyfin Servers
Your credentials are stored locally in your device's secure Keychain. Zenith connects directly to your server—we have no visibility into these connections.

### Google Drive
Zenith uses Google's OAuth to access your Drive. We request only:
- **drive.readonly** — To stream your media files
- **drive.appdata** — To sync your watch progress (visible only to you)

Your Google credentials are managed by Google, not stored by Zenith.

### Local Files
Files you import stay on your device. We don't upload or sync them anywhere.

---

## Downloads

Downloaded media is stored in your device's Documents folder, accessible via the Files app. This data never leaves your device unless you choose to share it.
